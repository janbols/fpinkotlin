____
It means we give the computer a set of instructions or commands, one after the other. As we do so, we are changing the system’s state with each step we take.
____

* recipe - easy to follow
* difficult to reason about as it grows

== Functional programming:

[quote]
____
We construct our programs using only pure functions—in other words, functions with no side effects.

== Pure function

> A function f with input type A and output type B is a computation that relates every value a of type A to exactly one value b of type B such that b is determined solely by the value of a


== Referential Transparency (RT) and the substitution model.
> An expression e is referentially transparent if, for all programs p, all occurrences of e in p can be replaced by the result of evaluating e without affecting the meaning of p.

RT enforces the rule that everything a function does should be represented by the value it returns, according to the function’s result type

=== Not RT
StringBuilder.append:
[source,kotlin]
----
>>> val x = StringBuilder("Hello")
    res10: kotlin.text.StringBuilder = Hello

>>> val r1 = x.append(", World").toString()
    res11: kotlin.String = Hello, World

>>> val r2 = x.append(", World").toString()
    res12: kotlin.String = Hello, World, World
----

=== RT
zie algebra: + * - / ()

=> local reasoning

====
A pure function is modular and composable because it separates the computation logic from “what to do with the result” and “how to obtain the input”;
